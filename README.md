# C Programming Projects

This repository contains various C programs demonstrating fundamental concepts and practical applications in systems programming, inter-process communication (IPC), networking, and concurrency.

## Project Overview

The repository includes a collection of C programs, each focusing on different aspects of C programming and system-level operations.

### Key Projects

* **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**: Implementation of CRC algorithms for error-checking in data transmission.
* **Dining Philosopher**: A simulation demonstrating synchronization issues and solutions in concurrent programming.
* **Message Queue**: Demonstrates the use of message queues for inter-process communication.
* **Reader-Writer Problem**: Shows synchronization mechanisms to handle multiple readers and writers accessing shared data.
* **TCP/UDP Client-Server**: Basic implementations of client-server communication using TCP and UDP protocols.
* **2D Parity Check**: Implementation of 2D parity check for error detection in data storage.
* **Bit Stuffing**: Demonstrates bit stuffing technique used in data link layer protocols.
* **Producer-Consumer Problem**: Classic synchronization problem illustrating the use of semaphores.
* **Semaphore and Signal Handling**: Programs demonstrating the use of semaphores and signal handling in process synchronization.
* **Thread Sort**: Implementation of sorting algorithms using threads to demonstrate multithreading in C.

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language**: C
* **System Calls**: POSIX threads (pthreads), semaphores, signals
* **Networking**: Sockets for TCP/UDP communication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
* POSIX-compliant operating system (Linux, macOS)([GitHub][1])

### Compilation

To compile any of the programs, navigate to the program's directory and run:

```bash
gcc -o program_name program_name.c -lpthread
```



Replace `program_name` with the actual file name of the program.

### Execution

After compilation, execute the program using:

```bash
./program_name
```



## Learning Resources

For understanding the concepts implemented in these programs, consider referring to the following resources:

* **The C Programming Language** by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie
* **Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment** by W. Richard Stevens
* **UNIX Network Programming** by W. Richard Stevens
